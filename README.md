# Sentiment Analysis with NLTK and VADER

This Python script performs sentiment analysis on user input using the NLTK library's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon. It provides real-time feedback on the sentiment of the entered sentences by categorizing them as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

## Features
- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of sentences entered by the user.
- **Sentiment Summary**: Provides an easy-to-understand summary of the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Continuously takes user input until the user types 'exit' to quit the program.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:
- **nltk** (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install `nltk` using `pip`:
```bash
pip install nltk
